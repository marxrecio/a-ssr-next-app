# Dynamic Weather Reporting with Next.js: Server-Side Rendered for Speed and SEO

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, designed for server-side rendering (SSR). It features a weather forecasting interface with real-time data fetching and a modern, responsive UI.

## Features
- Server-side rendered pages for faster load times and SEO benefits.
- Real-time weather forecasting interface.
- Integrated Material-UI components with custom theming.
- Styled-components for component-level styling.
- Responsive design for compatibility with various screen sizes.
- Uses `next/font` for font optimization.

## Getting Started
1. First, run the development server:

`npm run dev`

2. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

3. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
